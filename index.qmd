Biological systems compute through fast, distributed, and adaptive dynamics that are difficult to measure with existing tools. Our research focuses on developing quantitative optical instrumentation to measure biological activity with high temporal precision, stability, and interpretability, and on using these measurements to understand how cells—and particularly neurons—process information during behavior and learning.

Our lab is at [HHMI Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org/) (near Washington DC), a fully-funded non-profit research institution.

#### **Systems-Level Inference from Single Neurons**

By measuring synaptic glutamate release at spine resolution, we use single neurons as sensors of presynaptic population activity. This enables inference of network dynamics during behavior and learning.

#### **Quantitative optical measurements of cellular physiology**

We develop quantitative imaging methods that enable stable measurements of biological activity during behavior and across time.

#### **Photophysics of dark states**

Fluorescent probes are dynamical systems, and exploiting their non-equilibrium states enables new imaging modalities.
