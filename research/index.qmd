## Research Areas

We address fundamental limitations of current optical techniques for recording the activity and dynamics of biological samples. Below are three directions that attack neural recordings throughput (1), absolute quantification for stable recordings of microscopy data (2), and exploration of novel photophysical schemes for new imaging methods (3).

# Systems-Level Inference from Single Neurons {#systems}

::: {.research-section}

::: {.research-text}

By measuring synaptic glutamate release at spine resolution, we use single neurons as sensors of presynaptic population activity. This enables inference of network dynamics during behavior and learning.

Our approach leverages the fact that individual neurons integrate information from thousands of synaptic inputs. By measuring voltage dynamics in single neurons at subcellular resolution, we can infer the activity patterns of entire presynaptic networks.

# Quantitative Optical Measurements of Cellular Physiology {#optical}

::: {.research-section}

::: {.research-text}

We develop quantitative imaging methods that enable stable measurements of biological activity during behavior and across time.

Traditional fluorescence imaging is plagued by artifacts from photobleaching, motion, and optical aberrations. We develop methods that provide quantitative, stable measurements that can be compared across experiments, animals, and labs.

Our methods enable long-term tracking of neural activity patterns, absolute measurements of membrane voltage, and more reproducible results.

# Photophysics of Dark States {#photophysics}

::: {.research-section}

::: {.research-text}

Fluorescent probes are dynamical systems, and exploiting their non-equilibrium states enables new imaging modalities.

Fluorescent proteins and dyes exist in multiple photophysical states—bright, dark, and everything in between. Rather than treating these as nuisances, we exploit the dynamics of dark states to develop new measurement capabilities.

Our work has led to two-step excitation methods for improved voltage imaging, photoactivatable voltage indicators, and enhanced signal-to-noise through photophysical engineering.
