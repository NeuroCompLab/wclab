Unlike previous approaches that train models to restore pixel values, we trained Cellpose3 to output images that are well segmented by a generalist segmentation model, while maintaining perceptual similarity to the target images.

    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\nIndividual neurons in visual cortex provide the brain with unreliable estimates of visual features. It is not known whether the single-neuron variability is correlated across large neural populations, thus impairing the global encoding of stimuli. We recorded simultaneously from up to 50,000 neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) and in higher order visual areas and measured stimulus discrimination thresholds of 0.35° and 0.37°, respectively, in an orientation decoding task. These neural thresholds were almost 100 times smaller than the behavioral discrimination thresholds reported in mice. This discrepancy could not be explained by stimulus properties or arousal states. Furthermore, behavioral variability during a sensory discrimination task could not be explained by neural variability in V1. Instead, behavior-related neural activity arose dynamically across a network of non-sensory brain areas. These results imply that perceptual discrimination in mice is limited by downstream decoders, not by neural noise in sensory representations.\n\n\npaper | talk | HHMI news article | Scientifica article | preprint | data | code | original tweeprint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThread:\n\nSingle neurons in the brain can’t be depended on for reliable information. Here are some neurons from our recent study, recorded twice in response to the same visual stimuli. Different neurons are active at different times!\n\n\n\n\nAsk a neuron what angle the corner of your screen makes and it will say 75 degrees right now, 100 degrees in 5 minutes, and some other random number close to 90 every time you ask.\n\n\n\nThat is not how a computational device should work! Imagine if your calculator gave different answers every time\n\n\n\n\nThis makes our lives as neuroscientists hard. Single measurements of neurons are not reliable (gray dots), and we need to repeat the measurements many times to average out the noise (black line).\n\n\n\n\nMaybe, we thought, the brain uses some kind of averaging over its millions of noisy neurons to get a clean estimate of what it’s looking at.\n\n\n\nIf that was true, there would be “magical” combinations of neurons, which averaged would give just the right answer. Can we find these “magical” combinations by looking at the brain while it’s looking at our images? We used a microscope to record the activity of ~20,000 neurons simultaneously. Here is all of them from one session in random colors.\n\n\n\n\nWe used linear regression to find weights for each neuron that combine their activities into “super-neurons”.\n\n\n\n\nThese super-neurons were much less noisy than single neurons. In fact, the super-neurons could tell the difference between 45 and 46 degrees on 95% of the test trials. Can you?\n\n\n\n\nImagine asking a mouse to distinguish such small differences… Our colleagues in @BenucciLab actually tried! The mouse could only tell apart angle differences of 29 degrees, which was about 100 times worse than the neurons.\n\n\n\n\nEven for humans it’s difficult, but I bet you can see the difference if I make the pictures into a movie.\n\n\n\n\nWe conclude that mice have a lot of information in their brains, which are 1000x smaller than ours.\n\n\n\n\nThey can’t communicate this information to us, but that does not mean they don’t use it, for example as a first step to another computation.\n\n\n\n\nWe hope to find out in the future what these other computations might be.

    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) have been shown to predict neural responses in primary visual cortex (V1) better than classical models. However, this performance often comes at the expense of simplicity and interpretability. Here we introduce a new class of simplified ANN models that can predict over 70% of the response variance of V1 neurons. To achieve this high performance, we first recorded a new dataset of over 29,000 neurons responding to up to 65,000 natural image presentations in mouse V1. We found that ANN models required only two convolutional layers for good performance, with a relatively small first layer. We further found that we could make the second layer small without loss of performance, by fitting individual “minimodels” to each neuron. Similar simplifications applied for models of monkey V1 neurons. We show that the minimodels can be used to gain insight into how stimulus invariance arises in biological neurons.\n\n\npaper | code | tutorial | data | news coverage | preprint | original tweeprint\n\n\nThread by Fengtong Du:\n\nPredicting neural activity is notoriously difficult and requires complicated models. Here we develop simple “minimodels” which explain 70% of neural variance in V1! 🐭🐒\n\n\n\n\n\nWe started with population-level models, fitting all neurons together with 4 shared conv layers. These models performed better than past models because we showed many more images. The model predicted monkey V1 responses well too.\n\n\n\nBut we didn’t need such a deep network: two convolutional layers were sufficient, in both mice and monkeys. Also, the first layer could be very small, 16 filters, while the second layer did need to be large, in line with the high dimensionality of V1.\n\n\n\n\nThis structure – small first convolutional layer and large second convolutional layer – was advantageous for performing visual tasks, such as texture classification and image recognition.\n\n\n\n\nNext, can we simplify the wide second layer further? We found that using more neurons to fit the model did NOT help! This suggested that we could fit smaller models to individual neurons.\n\n\n\n\nSo we built a minimodel for each neuron, matching the performance of the best models. On average, mouse minimodels had 32 conv2 filters and monkey minimodels had 7, much fewer than the 320 filters in our previous model.\n\n\n\n\nNow equipped with a minimodel for each neuron, we used them to understand how the visual invariance of a single neuron develops across the model stages. We designed a metric, fraction of category variance (FECV) to measure this invariance.\n\n\n\n\nWe found that instead of gradually increasing, the invariance primarily emerges at the readout stage and is influenced by both pooling size and input channel similarity.\n\n\n\n\nWith these minimodels, we can also visualize the high and low FECV neurons in mouse and monkey V1.\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, we found single-neuron minimodels are just as powerful as larger ones! It offers an accurate and interpretable approach to studying visual computation across different species and experimental contexts. 🐭🐒\n\nHuge thanks to Janelia!

    "text": "Recent studies in mice have shown that orofacial behaviors drive a large fraction of neural activity across the brain. To understand the nature and function of these signals, we need better computational models to characterize the behaviors and relate them to neural activity. Here we developed Facemap, a framework consisting of a keypoint tracker and a deep neural network encoder for predicting neural activity. Our algorithm for tracking mouse orofacial behaviors was more accurate than existing pose estimation tools, while the processing speed was several times faster, making it a powerful tool for real-time experimental interventions. The Facemap tracker was easy to adapt to data from new labs, requiring as few as 10 annotated frames for near-optimal performance. We used the keypoints as inputs to a deep neural network which predicts the activity of ~50,000 simultaneously-recorded neurons and, in visual cortex, we doubled the amount of explained variance compared to previous methods. Using this model, we found that the neuronal activity clusters that were well predicted from behavior were more spatially spread out across cortex. We also found that the deep behavioral features from the model had stereotypical, sequential dynamics that were not reversible in time. In summary, Facemap provides a stepping stone toward understanding the function of the brain-wide neural signals and their relation to behavior.\n\narticle | preprint | code | Nature Methods highlight | news article | talk | tweeprint\n\n\n\n\nTutorial:\n\n\nGUI:\n \n\n\n\n\n  Powered by Quarto. © Marius Pachitariu & Carsen Stringer lab, 2023."

With the advent of large-scale recordings, such close observation of data has become difficult. To find patterns in large-scale neural data, we developed ‘Rastermap’, a visualization method that displays neurons as a raster plot after sorting them along a one-dimensional axis based on their activity patterns. We benchmarked Rastermap on realistic simulations and then used it to explore recordings of tens of thousands of neurons from mouse cortex during spontaneous, stimulus-evoked and task-evoked epochs. We also applied Rastermap to whole-brain zebrafish recordings; to wide-field imaging data; to electrophysiological recordings in rat hippocampus, monkey frontal cortex and various cortical and subcortical regions in mice; and to artificial neural networks.

Cortical variability and spontaneous activity have been variously proposed to represent random noise, recall of prior experience, or encoding of ongoing behavioral and cognitive variables. Recording more than 10,000 neurons in mouse visual cortex, we observed that spontaneous activity reliably encoded a high-dimensional latent state, which was partially related to the mouse’s ongoing behavior and was represented not just in visual cortex but also across the forebrain. Sensory inputs did not interrupt this ongoing signal but added onto it a representation of external stimuli in orthogonal dimensions. Thus, visual cortical population activity, despite its apparently noisy structure, reliably encodes an orthogonal fusion of sensory and multidimensional behavioral information.\n\n\npaper | talk | Quanta news article | Simons news article | preprint | data | code | original tweeprint\n\n\n\n\nThread:\n\nNeurons in the brain are very chatty: they fire action potentials, their basic unit of communication, even when there is nothing to communicate.

Some think the chattering is just noise. Others think the neurons are chatting about something very important, we just can’t understand their language.\n\nRecording one neuron at a time, we have no chance to understand this language. It’s like hearing only half of a conversation:\n\n\nNeuron B: “You’re just paranoid.” Neuron B: “He started it.”\n\n\nBut really more like only a millionth of it:\n\n\nNeuron B: “t”\n\nThe number of recorded neurons has improved dramatically. We can now pick up whole conversations:\n\n\nNeuron A: I think I saw something. Neuron B: You’re just paranoid. Neuron C: Shh, I’m trying to sleep here. Neuron B: He started it. Neuron D: I think we’re going to be eaten.\n\nWe recorded about 10,000 neurons and sorted their activity using an algorithm so you can see next to each other groups of neurons that talk about the same things:\n\n\n\n\nThis showed us there were many conversations going on at the same time. But we still didn’t know what the conversations were about.\n\nAnd for quite a while, we were clueless…\n\nBut then it hit us. It was movements! The neurons were talking about movements!\n\nThe neurons were following in real time the motor actions of the mouse, each of them chatting about a different type of movement!\n\nIn mice, these motor actions are things like running, whisking, grooming and sniffing:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe detected these motor actions from the videos using automated algorithms:\n\n\n\nAnd then used all this motor information to predict which neurons were chatting and when:\n\n\n\n\nWe predicted a lot, about 50% of the neural conversation. In fact, in every area of the brain we looked, we could predict about that much:\n\n\n\n\nTo conclude, neurons in mice, and probably in your brain, are always chatting about what you’re doing, even if these neurons normally respond to images or sounds or tickling.\n\nWhy are they having this conversation about motor actions? It’s a bit of a mystery. Our theory is that it helps the brain detect coincidences: when action X and stimulus Y happen at the same time.\n\nAction X + stimulus Y could often lead to a consequence Z. Z can be a juicy reward, or a dangerous situation.\n\nLuckily, there is a neuron in your brain somewhere who noticed the coincidence XY, so it can alert everyone about the possible consequence Z before it happens!\n\nThere are more esoteric interpretations, like the chattering being the mechanistic substrate of consciousness. We’ll leave this for others to ponder.\n\nWe shared the data, and the code to run the analyses. data: (figshare) code: (github.com/MouseLand/stringer-pachitariu-et-al-2018a)\n\n\n\nP.S.

    "text": "Spike sorting is the computational process of extracting the firing times of single neurons from recordings of local electrical fields. This is an important but hard problem in neuroscience, made complicated by the nonstationarity of the recordings and the dense overlap in electrical fields between nearby neurons. To address the spike-sorting problem, we have been openly developing the Kilosort framework. Here we describe the various algorithmic steps introduced in different versions of Kilosort. We also report the development of Kilosort4, a version with substantially improved performance due to clustering algorithms inspired by graph-based approaches. To test the performance of Kilosort, we developed a realistic simulation framework that uses densely sampled electrical fields from real experiments to generate nonstationary spike waveforms and realistic noise. We found that nearly all versions of Kilosort outperformed other algorithms on a variety of simulated conditions and that Kilosort4 performed best in all cases, correctly identifying even neurons with low amplitudes and small spatial extents in high drift conditions.\n\npaper | code | talk | HHMI news article | preprint\n\n\n\n\nGraphical user interface:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Powered by Quarto. © Marius Pachitariu & Carsen Stringer lab, 2023."

    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\nCortical networks exhibit intrinsic dynamics that drive coordinated, large-scale fluctuations across neuronal populations and create noise correlations that impact sensory coding. To investigate the network-level mechanisms that underlie these dynamics, we developed novel computational techniques to fit a deterministic spiking network model directly to multi-neuron recordings from different rodent species, sensory modalities, and behavioral states. The model generated correlated variability without external noise and accurately reproduced the diverse activity patterns in our recordings. Analysis of the model parameters suggested that differences in noise correlations across recordings were due primarily to differences in the strength of feedback inhibition. Further analysis of our recordings confirmed that putative inhibitory neurons were indeed more active during desynchronized cortical states with weak noise correlations. Our results demonstrate that network models with intrinsically-generated variability can accurately reproduce the activity patterns observed in multi-neuron recordings and suggest that inhibition modulates the interactions between intrinsic dynamics and sensory inputs to control the strength of noise correlations.\n\n\npaper\n\n\nOur brains contain billions of neurons, which are continually producing electrical signals to relay information around the brain. Yet most of our knowledge of how the brain works comes from studying the activity of one neuron at a time. Recently, studies of multiple neurons have shown that they tend to be active together in short bursts called “up” states, which are followed by periods in which they are less active called “down” states. When we are sleeping or under a general anesthetic, the neurons may be completely silent during down states, but when we are awake the difference in activity between the two states is usually less extreme. However, it is still not clear how the neurons generate these patterns of activity.\n\nTo address this question, we studied the activity of neurons in the brains of awake and anesthetized rats, mice and gerbils. The experiments recorded electrical activity from many neurons at the same time and found a wide range of different activity patterns:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe built a spiking neuronal network model which recapitulated the up and down states in the data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe fit the model parameters directly to the neural activity, and reproduced the spiking patterns across brain states:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe found that increasing the strength of these inhibitory signals in the model decreased the fluctuations in electrical activity across entire areas of the brain. Further analysis of the experimental data supported the model’s predictions by showing that inhibitory neurons – which act to reduce electrical activity in other neurons – were more active when there were fewer fluctuations in activity across the brain, in both anesthetized and awake animals.\n\n\nIn particular, in awake mice, we observed decreases in noise correlations and increases in inhibitory activity during locomotion:\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the paper for more details.\n\n\n\n\n  Powered by Quarto. © Marius Pachitariu & Carsen Stringer lab, 2023."

In the sensory cortex, perceptual learning drives neural plasticity, but it is not known whether this is due to supervised or unsupervised learning. Here we recorded populations of up to 90,000 neurons simultaneously from the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas (HVAs) while mice learned multiple tasks, as well as during unrewarded exposure to the same stimuli. Similar to previous studies, we found that neural changes in task mice were correlated with their behavioural learning. However, the neural changes were mostly replicated in mice with unrewarded exposure, suggesting that the changes were in fact due to unsupervised learning. The neural plasticity was highest in the medial HVAs and obeyed visual, rather than spatial, learning rules. In task mice only, we found a ramping reward-prediction signal in anterior HVAs, potentially involved in supervised learning. Our neural results predict that unsupervised learning may accelerate subsequent task learning, a prediction that we validated with behavioural experiments.\n\n\npaper | news article | dataset | code | preprint |\n\nThread by Lin Zhong:\n\nSimple question: How do we learn? Answer: From teachers (supervised).\n\nSure! But we also learn a lot on our own (unsupervised), and so do our mice.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe developed a virtual reality (VR) task in which mice discriminated textures in order to get reward (supervised cohort) OR they just ran for FUN (unsupervised cohort).\n\n\n\nMice learned to discriminate textures by licking in the corridor with reward.\n\n\n\n\nWe recorded up to 90,000 neurons from the visual cortex during learning to try to understand the neural mechanism.

We don’t need supervised learning at all?

One possible answer is to pre-train our neural network for subsequent tasks.

    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\nA neuronal population encodes information most efficiently when its stimulus responses are high-dimensional and uncorrelated, and most robustly when they are lower-dimensional and correlated. Here we analysed the dimensionality of the encoding of natural images by large populations of neurons in the visual cortex of awake mice. The evoked population activity was high-dimensional, and correlations obeyed an unexpected power law: the nth principal component variance scaled as 1/n. This scaling was not inherited from the power law spectrum of natural images, because it persisted after stimulus whitening. We proved mathematically that if the variance spectrum was to decay more slowly then the population code could not be smooth, allowing small changes in input to dominate population activity. The theory also predicts larger power-law exponents for lower-dimensional stimulus ensembles, which we validated experimentally. These results suggest that coding smoothness may represent a fundamental constraint that determines correlations in neural population codes.\n\n\npaper | talk | Quanta news article | Simons news article | preprint | data | code | original tweeprint\n\n\n\nA picture is worth a thousand words, and your brain needs billions of neurons to process it. Why do we need so many neurons? To find out, we recorded thousands of them in mouse visual cortex.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne reason to have so many neurons may be that they each have different jobs:\n\nNeuron A recognizes the pointedness of a fox’s ears, Neuron B recognizes the color of the fox’s fur.  Neuron C recognizes a fox nose,  etc\n\n\n\n\nWhen enough of these neurons activate, the brain as a whole can recognize a fox.\n\n\n\n\nWhat if some neurons “fall asleep” on the job and don’t respond to the image? This actually happens very often, and yet the brain is remarkably robust to these failures.\n\nEven if 90% of the neurons don’t do their job, we can still recognize the fox. Even if we randomly change 90% of the pixels, we can still recognize the fox. The brain is robust to a lot of manipulations like that.\n\n\n\n\nArtificial neural networks also use millions of neurons to recognize images.\n\n\n\n\nUnlike brains, machines are not so robust to small aberrations. Here is our fox and next to it the same fox very slightly modified and now the machine thinks it’s a puffer fish!\n\n\n\n\nThese are called “adversarial images”, because we devised them to fool the machine. How does the brain protect against these perturbations and others?\nOne protection could be to make many slightly different copies of the neurons that represent foxes. Even if some neurons fall asleep on the job, their copies might still activate.\n\nHowever, if the brain used so many neurons for every single image, we would quickly run out of neurons!\n\nThis results in an evolutionary pressure: it’s good to have many neurons do very different jobs so we can recognize lots of objects in images, but it’s also good if they share some responsibilities, so they can pick up the slack when necessary.\n\nWe found evidence for this by investigating the main dimensions of variation in the responses of 10,000 neurons. Below, each column is one neuron’s responses to several of our images.\n\n\n\n\nThe largest two dimensions were distributed broadly across all neurons, as you see below. Any neuron could contribute to these and pick up the slack if the other neurons did not respond.\n\n\n\n\nThe next 8 dimensions each were smaller and distributed more sparsely across neurons. If a neuron was asleep, it was still likely a few others could represent these dimensions in its place.\n\n\n\n\nThe next 30 dimensions revealed ever more intricate structure…\n\n\n\n\nAnd so did the next 160 dimensions…\n\n\n\n\nAnd so on, this kept on going, with the N-th dimension being about N times smaller than the biggest dimension.\n\nThis distribution of activity is called a “power-law”.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, this was not just any power-law, it had a special exponent of approx 1. We did some math and showed that a power-law with this exponent must be borderline fractal.\n\nA fractal is a mathematical object that has structure at many different spatial scales, like the Mandelbrot set below:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Inceptionism movie is also a kind of fractal:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe neural activity was so close to being a fractal, and just barely avoided it because it’s exponent was 1.04, not 1 or smaller.\n\nAn exponent of 1.04 is the sweet spot: as high-dimensional as possible without being a fractal.\n\nNot being a fractal allows neural responses to be continuous and smooth, which are the minimal protections neurons need so that we don’t confuse a fox with a puffer fish!\nWe shared the data, and the code to run the analyses.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\nPretrained neural network models for biological segmentation can provide good out-of-the-box results for many image types. However, such models do not allow users to adapt the segmentation style to their specific needs and can perform suboptimally for test images that are very different from the training images. Here we introduce Cellpose 2.0, a new package that includes an ensemble of diverse pretrained models as well as a human-in-the-loop pipeline for rapid prototyping of new custom models. We show that models pretrained on the Cellpose dataset can be fine-tuned with only 500–1,000 user-annotated regions of interest (ROI) to perform nearly as well as models trained on entire datasets with up to 200,000 ROI. A human-in-the-loop approach further reduced the required user annotation to 100–200 ROI, while maintaining high-quality segmentations. We provide software tools such as an annotation graphical user interface, a model zoo and a human-in-the-loop pipeline to facilitate the adoption of Cellpose 2.0.\n\n\npaper | talk | tutorial | news & views | preprint | code | original tweeprint\n\nThis is an upgrade to Cellpose; if you’re unfamiliar with Cellpose, check it out here.\nCellpose 2.0 thread:\n\nYou can now train your own state-of-the-art models in less than 1 hour, all from the GUI. Massive improvements for some images!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCellpose 1.0 is great, but we were getting reports of imperfect segmentations on some image categories, e.g. on some new large-scale datasets, like TissueNet and LiveCell (see the two images above).\nAs we dove into these datasets, we realized that different people just segment cells in different ways. Here are some representative examples from different datasets:\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice how in different images more or less of the cytoplasm is segmented? Or how nuclei may or may not be segmented when they don’t have cytoplasm? Or how too dense regions are sometimes not annotated? The list goes on and on.\n\nIt’s impossible for a single model like Cellpose 1.0 to segment the same image in multiple ways. For this we had to build multiple models with different segmentation styles, i.e.:\n\n\n\n\n\nAll these segmentation styles are available in Cellpose 2.0 at the click of a button. Try them out!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis led us to think more carefully about personalized models for everyone. The main challenge is that deep learning typically requires a lot of training data…\nExcept it doesn’t. Not necessarily. When we initialize with Cellpose 1.0, a new model can be trained with ~500 segmented ROIs. The gains beyond that are minimal.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we can further reduce the training data requirement to 100-200 ROIs simply with a human-in-the-loop approach, where the user fixes the mistake of the algorithm instead of segmenting from scratch.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the user segments more, new models are trained that require even fewer corrections. Within a few iterations, very competitive models can be trained, which match human performance (see blue curve below):\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s our human-in-the-loop pipeline in action. We start by correcting the mistakes of Cellpose 1.0 (2x speedup)\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we train a new model on the single image we just segmented:\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter ~30 minutes, the user trains the fifth model, and this provides great results on various new images:\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the entire 30 minute procedure on youtube.\nFinal reveal: I [Marius] was the “human-in-the-loop” for all experiments! It’s actually quite fun. Try it out and please send us more training data via upload in the GUI. code: https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose\n\n\nThe End.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Powered by Quarto. © Marius Pachitariu & Carsen Stringer lab, 2023."

    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\nArtificial neural networks learn faster if they are initialized well. Good initializations can generate high-dimensional macroscopic dynamics with long timescales. It is not known if biological neural networks have similar properties. Here we show that the eigenvalue spectrum and dynamical properties of large-scale neural recordings in mice (two-photon and electrophysiology) are similar to those produced by linear dynamics governed by a random symmetric matrix that is critically normalized. An exception was hippocampal area CA1: population activity in this area resembled an efficient, uncorrelated neural code, which may be optimized for information storage capacity. Global emergent activity modes persisted in simulations with sparse, clustered or spatial connectivity. We hypothesize that the spontaneous neural activity reflects a critical initialization of whole-brain neural circuits that is optimized for learning time-dependent tasks.\n\n\npreprint | code | bluesky thread\n\nThread:\n\nWhat if… spontaneous neural activity 🧠 reflects the baseline rumblings of a brainwide dynamical system initialized for learning? We find that the rumblings have macroscopic properties like those emerging from linear symmetric, critical systems 🧵 #neuroscience #neuroAI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong timescales and large principal components (PCs) can be produced by a dynamical system with random connectivity and independent stochastic inputs, if the connectivity matrix is critically-normalized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the principal components in the model decay as a power-law, a phenomenon we have previously reported in large-scale neural recordings: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aav7893; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1346-5\nIn V1 and brainwide ephys recordings we observed that the PC variances decayed as a power-law with exponents of 0.7-0.85, consistent with symmetric, critically-normalized simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in hippocampus, we observed exponents around 0.5 that did not change after shuffling, suggesting that hippocampal activity is closer to completely independent neurons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model also predicted that higher PCs have longer timescales, which was true in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn estimate of the dynamics matrix of the data (using DMD) revealed mostly real eigenvalues, further supporting symmetric dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal emergent activity modes persisted in simulations with sparse, clustered or spatial connectivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulations with spatial connectivity replicated several of the properties we observed in the neural recordings, such as a spatial dependence of top correlated neuron pairs, and top PCs which were globally spread across cortex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe hypothesize that the spontaneous neural activity reflects a critical initialization of whole-brain neural circuits that is optimized for learning tasks that are time-dependent and working-memory dependent.
